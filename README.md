# Newton-Raphson
Programme to calculate all roots of any polynomial (complex and real both) using Newton-Raphson's method.
Basically using the concept below :

loop until all roots calculated {

-Newton-Raphson method on function {

    gives a random root}
	
-new function = (old function)/(x-root) 
}
